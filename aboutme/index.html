  <h2>Hello, my name is Jamison!</h2>

  <!-- Paragraphs about you -->
  <p>I am pursuing a degree in Business Management with an interest in human behavior and leadership. I love learning how teams work together and how to motivate people.</p>

  <p>Outside of school, I’m very entrepreneurial. I’ve run multiple small businesses, I buy and resell items online, and I am currently working on building Zynqar, an augmented reality platform that combines navigation, tourism, and social features.</p>

  <p>In my free time I enjoy riding my motorcycle, creating digital projects, and working on design ideas. I’m excited about this course because learning HTML and web design will help me share my projects and ideas more effectively!</p>

  <h2>A favorite quote</h2>
  <p>“Choose you this day whom ye will serve… but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Joshua 24:15)</p>
